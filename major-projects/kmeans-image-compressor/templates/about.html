            </h3>
            <p>
                Traditional image compression (like standard JPEG) works by analyzing frequencies and discarding visual information that the human eye is less sensitive to. It's a trick played on your vision.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tool takes a fundamentally different approach. It doesn't blur details; it restructures the image's data. By analyzing the entire color space of an image, we use <b>Unsupervised Machine Learning</b> to rebuild the image using a drastically restricted, mathematically optimized palette of colors.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
                The result is an image with a significantly smaller file size that retains sharp edges and a distinct, often artistic, aesthetic.

        The Engine: K-Means Clustering
    </h3>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-12">
            <p>
                The core of this tool is the <b>K-Means algorithm</b>. It is an algorithm used to find groups (clusters) in unlabelled data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine every pixel in your image is a point plotted in a 3D space (Red axis, Green axis, Blue axis). A colorful photo forms a dense cloud of millions of points.
            </p>
            <p class="text" style="color: #0f7d63;">How K-Means works here:</p>
            <ol class="text list-spaced">
                <li class="mb-2">You tell the algorithm how many colors you want in the final image (the value of <b>K</b>).</li>
                <li class="mb-2">The algorithm places <i>K</i> points randomly into that 3D color cloud.</li>
                <li class="mb-2">It iteratively moves those points until they sit in the exact gravitational center of the densest clusters of colors.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="mt-3 mb-0">
                The final image is reconstructed by snapping every original pixel to its nearest optimized center color.

        Intelligent Automation (Entropy)
    </h3>
    <p>
        The hardest part of palette reduction is choosing the right number of colors ($K$). Choose too few, and the image looks posterized and banded. Choose too many, and the file size remains large.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our "Auto K" feature utilizes concepts from <b>Information Theory (specifically Shannon Entropy)</b>.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-0 text" style="color: #0f7d63;">
        Before compressing, the system calculates the statistical "entropy" of the original image—essentially measuring how "busy" or complex the information content is. A flat blue sky has low entropy; a dense forest photo has high entropy. We use this score to intelligently map the image to an optimal $K$ value that balances visual fidelity against file size savings, without human guesswork.
